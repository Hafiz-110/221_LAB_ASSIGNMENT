Task:
Given the adjacency list representation of a simple directed unweighted graph
with N nodes, prepare the adjacency matrix representation of that graph.
The nodes are numbered from 0 to (N-1).

Input:
First line contains the number of tests. The description of each test follows.
Each test is described by (N+1) lines. First line contains N. The i'th line
contains the adjacency list of node numbered (i-2). The first integer in each
of these lines, K, is the number of adjacent nodes of node numbered (i-2). Then
K more distinct integer follow in the same line, representing the adjacent
nodes of node numbered (i-2).

Output:
For each test in the given order, print N lines each containing N integers,
representing the adjacency matrix which you are asked to prepare in this task.

Time limit: 1s (cpp) or 1.5s (java) or 3s (py) per batch.

Hints:
- Use fast input/output methods.
- 0.2 score for passing only sample batches.
- O(N^2) solution is expected.
